                            Since his beginnings, Ruma's creation process is not focused on the way we use the object but on the sensitivity in the perception of its designs. She is always looking for a singularity in his minimalist shaping. Her line is subjective because always sensitive.
            
                            Her first important wood projects enhanced a long relationship between the designer and this material. Already attached to natural resources, the attraction would continue to grow until becoming his first medium. She is actually closely related to his cultural heredity, to the perception he has of his environment. Ruma loves to connect this cultural legacy with the new opportunities of our times, in the concepts, the manufacturing process and the technologies that he deals with as much caution as his interest therein. <br>
